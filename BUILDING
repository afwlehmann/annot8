Building from source on Windows
===============================

Simply double-click the provided Visual Studio solution file, choose the
"Release" build and go ahead. You may want to use the provided setup project to
build an appropriate installer application.


Building from source on Linux
=============================

1) # qmake CONFIG-=debug
2) # make

eventually, if desired:

3) mv build/release/annot8 /usr/local/bin/.

Please note that when running the executable, it will look for the file
experiment.sql in the current directory. So, wherever you plan to run the
executable from, first make sure that you have copied the file
res/unix/experiment.sql to this location.


Building from source on OS X
============================

1) # qmake CONFIG-=debug
2) # make
3) # cp res/unix/experiment.sql build/release/annot8.app/Contents/Resources/.

eventually, if desired:

4) # mv build/release/annot8.app /Applications/.

For the time being, you have to manually resolve the neccessary library
dependencies for the built executable. You may want to use "otool -L" and
"install_name_tool" for this purpose. Please refer to Apple's documentation for
this issue.


Dependencies
============

You'll need at least the following libraries:
    - libQtCore,
    - libQtGui,
    - libQtSql,
    - libSDL and
    - libSDL_sound.
